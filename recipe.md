Prep everything beforehand: chop the veggies, get the sauce ready – do everything before you start making the recipe. You can fry the paneer, set it aside and then do all the prep work before you start working on the gravy.

Since we cook everything on high heat, it all comes together quickly and there’s hardly anytime to chop things in between.

Use sesame oil:  I use toasted sesame oil in this chilli paneer recipe and it does make a difference to the final taste.

Use celery: same as sesame oil. Using finely chopped celery really enhances the flavors.
Cook on high heat: when cooking the veggies, the wok should constantly be oh high heat. You want all veggies to remain crunchy. Lower the flame once you have added the sauce.

Use quality ingredients: I always believe that using quality ingredients makes so much difference to the final outcome of the dish.

So do use good quality soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil etc.

I also use 2 types of soy sauce, a regular one and dark soy sauce. If you can get hold of the dark soy sauce, you should do the same.

It gives the paneer a nice dark color.

Serving Suggestions
You can serve this as an appetizer or as a main course.

It’s kind of semi-dry version so it works both ways.

If serving as an appetizer, serve it as such.

If serving as a main course, pair it with plain brown rice, fried rice or noodles.

 

Method
1- Cut paneer into cubes. To a large bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 3 tablespoons flour along with salt, pepper.

2- Add water to make a free flowing batter, it should neither be thick nor thin. I added little less than 1/2 cup water here. Meanwhile heat oil in a wok/kadai on medium heat to deep fry the paneer.

3- Dip each paneer cube into the batter.

4- And then add them into the hot oil.
5- Fry until the paneer pieces get golden brown and crispy from both sides. Drain the fried paneer on paper towel.

Meanwhile, in a measuring jar or bowl, add soy sauce (I use regular and dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon each), rice vinegar, green chili sauce, tomato ketchup and sugar. Mix until all is well combined and set aside.

Also mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water until cornstarch dissolves completely and set aside.

6- Heat sesame oil and avocado oil in wok on medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, celery and green chili. Saute for 1 minute.

7- Then add the quartered onion and peppers.

8- Cook for 2 minutes. Veggies should remain crunchy and you should cook on high heat.
9- Add in the prepared sauce and mix and lower heat to medium.

10- Then add in the prepared cornstarch slurry. Mix well, sauce will begin to thicken. Add additional 3 to 4 tablespoons water.

11- Stir in the fried paneer cubes. Toss to combine the paneer with the sauce.

12- Turn off heat and garnish with green onions.
